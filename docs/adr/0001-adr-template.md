# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

**Status**: Template  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Decision makers**: Core Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. This template establishes the standard format for all future ADRs in the Spike-Transformer-Compiler project.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for transparent decision-making process
- Requirement to document architectural reasoning
- Enable future team members to understand historical decisions
- Support project maintainability and evolution

## Considered Options

1. No formal documentation of architectural decisions
2. Informal documentation in code comments
3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
4. Comprehensive architecture documentation

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Positive Consequences

- Clear documentation of decision context and reasoning
- Structured format enables easy review and understanding
- Version-controlled alongside code changes
- Lightweight process that doesn't impede development velocity

### Negative Consequences

- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain consistently
- May become outdated if not actively maintained

## Implementation

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` directory with the naming convention:
- `NNNN-short-title.md` where NNNN is a sequential number
