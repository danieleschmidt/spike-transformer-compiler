# spike-transformer-compiler
A TVM-style compiler that converts PyTorch SpikeFormer models into optimized binaries for Intel Loihi 3 neuromorphic hardware. Based on CVPR 2025's DSFormer kernels and Intel's Loihi 3 API preview, this toolkit enables efficient deployment of spike-based transformers on neuromorphic chips.
